# TODO list

Here are all the things this game is missing to be complete, in priority order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest). Feel free to remove them once one of them is done:

- add a settings screen (accessible from the UI) where all the more complex settings (like sensibility of movement detection) can be accessed. In the future, other settings will be accessed through this screen
