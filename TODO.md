# TODO list

Here are all the things this game is missing to be complete, in priority order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest). Feel free to remove them once one of them is done:

- motion sensors work for connecting from an android phone. That doesn't actually work for ios though. When I'm in the /join page I don't see the request motion sensors access button show up (may this be because I already accepted it in the past?). I also developed another app where that works correctly for websocket connections. It's in the same directory as this project and is called wolfgang-amadeus-joust
- add a settings screen (accessible from the UI) where all the more complex settings (like sensibility of movement detection) can be accessed. In the future, other settings will be accessed through this screen
