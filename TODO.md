# TODO list

Here are all the things this game is missing to be complete, in priority order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest). Feel free to remove them once one of them is done:

- both in classic mode and role based mode, round count should be settable from the settings. They should not have special defaults, and setting the round count on the main menu should reflect on both
- add a settings screen (accessible from the UI) where all the more complex settings (like sensibility of movement detection) can be accessed. In the future, other settings will be accessed through this screen
