# TODO list

Here are all the things this game is missing to be complete, in priority order from top (highest priority) to bottom (lowest). Feel free to remove them once one of them is done:

- I want to add a new control to the game: tapping on the player screen. Players will have their phone bound to their chest but they will be placed so they can easily be tapped. What I want is to be able to tap the phone to send an event that could be used by the role or by an ongoing event (e.g. maybe an event in the future will require players to tap on their screen within 5 seconds to avoid dying). As a proof of concept, please implement a new role who can activate a power on tap, making him take half damage for 5 seconds (toughness = 2). When activating the power, effects/power-activation.mp3 must play on the player's phone.
- I want better handling for player stats (e.g. toughness or dangerThreshold). I want to add dangerThresholdMultiplier as a new prop for the player (configurable for roles). This should multiply the base dangerThreshold. But we have an issue if we do it like this: we aren't able to handle multiplier from game events (e.g. speed shift) together with player multiplier. I think we should in general expect these two to coexist. Not only for this new multiplier, but also for others in the future (and for toughnessMultiplier). Also, I would remove dangerThreshold from player props, since we don't ever want to override globally configured dangerThreshold. The multiplier will be enough.
- add visual feedback on phone screen when the player gets hit
- add a settings screen (accessible from the UI) where all the more complex settings (like sensibility of movement detection) can be accessed. In the future, other settings will be accessed through this screen
- music loop doesn't work
